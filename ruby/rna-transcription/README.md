# Rna Transcription

Write a program that can translate a given DNA string to the corresponding transcribed RNA string.

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and thymidine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`
